# CI guard: project templates must be `tofu plan -out`-safe — the runner's ONLY path.
#
# The runner deploys via `tofu plan -out=<file>` then applies that saved plan
# (packages/core/tofu/tofu.go: Plan uses tfexec.Out; Apply replays it). A saved plan
# must resolve EVERY provider config at plan time. A Kubernetes/Helm/kubectl provider
# configured from the cluster's OWN known-after-apply kubeconfig therefore makes
# `tofu plan -out` fail *before apply* — so the runner can never deploy that template.
# This shipped undetected on Hetzner (see #295: CNI/CCM/CSI were applied via in-tofu
# `kubectl_manifest` resources wired from `talos_cluster_kubeconfig`) because CI only
# ran `tofu validate`, which never evaluates provider configs.
#
# Invariant: a project template MUST NOT apply Kubernetes objects in-tofu. Post-cluster
# manifests belong in Talos `cluster.inlineManifests` (self-managed) or the runner's
# post-apply path (managed ArgoCD / marketplace add-ons). Offline `data "helm_template"`
# renderers are fine — they never connect to a cluster, so they resolve at plan time.

# ── Second invariant: the AZ / zone COUNT must be plan-known ──────────────────────────────────

# The same `tofu plan -out` requirement means every `count`/`for_each` must resolve at plan. An
# availability-zones DATA SOURCE resolves to UNKNOWN at plan under the runner's deferred provider
# (assume-role / OIDC / WIF / RAM — credentials only resolve at apply). So `azs = data.<...>zones`
# or `length(data.<...>zones)` feeding a subnet/NAT count makes the count undeterminable → the
# plan fails "Invalid count argument" BEFORE apply. This broke the real aws nightly (#551, fixed in
# #608 by deriving AZs statically). Derive the AZ/zone count from a plan-known static list instead.
